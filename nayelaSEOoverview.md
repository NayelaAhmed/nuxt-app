SEO knowledge learned through slides/research

User experience has become every marketer’s priority. Everyone wants visibility and better 
ranking for their brand. Digital age has become the way of life in the business world, 
and SEO plays a big part in it, because it tells us what customers want and need. 
As a business owner SEO is vitally important for the success of my business. I am no expert
when it comes to SEO, but gaining knowledge about SEO and using it to promote the vitality of my 
business will go a long way. Among many important information learned in the video and the resources, 
what stood out to me most was how SEO impacts the buying circle. Research is becoming a critical element of SEO. 
Local SEO enhances the visibility and lets customers find the answers that the businesses provide. 
So, what does “Local SEO” mean? It means increased engagement by customers and more traffic on your website. 
Local search has become a fundamental part of every business.  With the growing rise of mobile search, you must think about
how quickly your site will load on the mobile phone. I find it interesting how Google search controls the business as well 
as the customer. SEO now touches nearly every aspect of business. Eighty one percent of customers and 94% of buyers will 
perform searches online before they make a purchase. Brands that do not have a strong online presence will find themselves 
falling behind their competition.

I remember couple years back when I worked in retail, and the voice of the customer then was how our team improved the business. 
Now, SEO has become the best way to understand the voice of the customer. So, how does SEO understand the voice of the customer? 
SEO collects data and formats words that give us a clear intent of the user behavior.  Some of the other ways SEO does this are 
the following: Search query data, SERP analysis, Analytics data and AI-insights. Out of the tools mentioned ….what I found most 
interesting was how SEO and Machine learning are joining forces. Should we as humans worry about this? Will AI – Artificial 
Intelligence replace humans in the future? I was happy to find out from my research that even the most advanced machine learning 
tools can’t replace the humans behind them. But if the greatest challenge for marketers and SEO professionals is activating and 
using the data they find, question I ask is can human professionals handle data processing on their own in the future? 
Or will we rely on machine learning tools then human Marketers and SEO? Each connected person in 2025 will have at least one 
data interaction every 18 seconds. If 30% of the world’s data need real-time processing, can we as human marketers handle this 
processing on our own? 

What will resonate with me most about SEO is how the crawler goes through your website content and looks for key words. 
Interesting how the spiders as we know it, also looks for food and builds its home just like a web. Another aspect of SEO was 
tracking Keyword of your competitors. It is much like having the key to a door that will open new opportunities for your business.
