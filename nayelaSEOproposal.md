Today, we have grown to employ over 25 people across the nation. Our company has helped over 100 brands increase their traffic through SEO.



Our Approach:

We start our process by establishing were you company site is at this time. We look into how your company is doing on SEO. For example, the amount of organic traffic you are already getting. 
Then we look at keywords your website is ranking at this time, and what are the most important key words we need to use. We also look at the overall site. Following that we look at any 
potential issues that your website is experiencing due to current traffic. So, once we establish a baseline, then that will help us create a goal for your company website.


Our process:

1.  The Foundation

We will begin the process by using different tools like Google Search Engine to crawl your website. These tools will let us collect the information we need to learn how well your website is ranking. 
Once we establish the foundation, and your needs we will start developing your strategy for your website.

2. Your websites accessibility

After we collect the data, we will learn how well search engines are able to crawl and access your website. 
Then we will look for issues in your websites meta-data, sitemaps, site architecture, navigation, and the framework. This will let us know two things. A) How well search engines can access your website. 
B) How well search engines can understand your website. Then we will check your site performance. How fast it will loan on desktop computer, laptop, iPhone, smart phone. 

3. Indexing

After making sure search engines can access and understand your website, we will make sure that they can index it too. 
Indexing means search engines are including your website in their results when someone looks up information. We will implement this by searching various queries on Google, Bing and find out 
how many pages are included in your website from the users search results. If for any reason some pages are not accessible, we will give you solutions to index them.  

4. On-page Optimization

After making sure your website is SEO friendly and indexed we go into the following factors: Content, URLS, duplicate content, keyword cannibalism, HTML mark-up, interlinking. 
These factors will help us improve your site’s ranking.

5. Off-page Optimization

What’s not on your website is just as important as what is on your website. We use the following:
•	High quality site linking.
•	Backlinks help determine your page authority.
•	Review your website popularity compared to your competitors.
•	Page authority and domain authority.
•	Start binding links to your website through different tactics.

6.  Analysis of your competition

We will review three of your competitor’s website. When we look at what your competitors are doing, we can identify gaps in your own strategy and begin to take care of deficits. This will give you fantastic opportunities to improve your site’s results.

7. Issues we fix

Missing alt tags:
After the review if we look at issues that may come up like missing alt tags and broken images. Broken images and missing alt tags cause the same problem as broken links. Broken links are a dead end for both search engines and web users. This can create a very poor user experience and downgrade your page rank. That’s why it is always wise to include alt tags and correct any broken images.

Meta description issues:
The fewer clicks your website gets, the lower the search engine will rank it. When you provide relevant Meta description, you are making sure your user will click on your website and it will help your website rank higher.

Low word count:
Words help search engines understand the purpose of a page, but there is no minimum word count in SEO. Google is very particular, it prefers relevant content.

Broken external and internal links:
Broken links can be extremely damaging to SEO. The more your website contains these issues the fewer users friendly it will become.

Meta description improvement:
Meta descriptions always have to be informative, and relevant to the page. We need to make sure Meta description is at a limit of 155 characters.
